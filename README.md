# Student scheduling tool 

Program is to be used for tracking student course schedules. 

The program uses two classes (students and rosters) for scheduling. 

The program maintains a current roster of students within a given course. Student data for the program includes student ID, first name, last name, email address, age, an array of the number of days to complete each course, and degree program.

The program reads a list of five students and uses function calls to manipulate data. While parsing the list of data, the program creates student objects. The entire student list is stored in one array of students called classRosterArray. Specific data-related outputs are directed to the console.
