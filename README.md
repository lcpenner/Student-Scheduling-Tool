# Program written for C867-Scripting-and-Programming

Program is to be used for tracking student course schedules. 

The program uses two classes (students and rosters), each with its own attributes and methods. Each instance of roster contained an array of students enrolled in the course. 

The scheduling application uses a method to parse the student data (converted from CSV to student objects in the roster array), then uses the data to display schedule information such as the class roster list or the average days a student has been in the course.
